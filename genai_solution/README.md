# Development code
- Every individual and team should create themselves a folder in genai_solution/teams/ to keep their code.
- Decide within your teams how you want to manage this space and any code.
- Keep your work within your folder and take care not to impact the work of other teams/individuals.

# Hero Code
This code will act as a kickstart for anyone who joins late or misses a week.

Before adding your code to genai_solution/hero_code/ check the following:
- The code runs
- The file is named for the week and the task eg W1_Data_Exploration
- Any package requirements (outside the usual) are noted
- The code is commented and clear to follow
- Your name and the names of your team members are included (if on a team)
